  #Background:
  #  Given an existing centre type named "Tipus1"
  #  And another existing centre type name "Tipus2"

  Scenario: Create first centre
    Given there are no centres created
    When I create a new centre with code "FCS" and name "Medicina i Ci√®ncies de la Salut"
    Then there should be 1 centres in the list

  Scenario: Create centre with repeated code
    Given one centre with code "ARQ"
    When I create a new centre with repeated code "ARQ" and name "Escola d'Arquitectura"
    Then I should see "ja existeix el codi!!"
    And there should be 1 centres in the list

  Scenario: Create centre with repeated name
    Given one centre with name "Facultat de Dret"
    When I create a new centre with code "CJP" and repeated name "Facultat de Dret"

    And there should be 1 centres in the list
